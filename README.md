# Welcome to the Death vs. Black Metal classifier

The goal of this project was to use simple NLP techniques 
to train a classifier to distinguish between lyrics of songs 
belonging to the death or black metal genre.

## The results
For the description of the projects and its results see the [GitPage](https://maraungu.github.io/metal-classifier/).

## The code
The project was carried out mostly inside a `Jupyter Notebook` also
available here.  The functions used in the analysis of the
results are defined in `analysis.py` and `metal_lda.py` 
contains the necessary definitions for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
The trained logistic regression classifier is saved as `metal-class.joblib`.
